            <h1>Bee Swarm Simulator</h1>
            <p>Bee Swarm Simulator is a Roblox game created in March 2019. At creation, it was the 
                most played game on Roblox. Even now, over 6 years later, it is still one of the most
                popular games on Roblox.</p>

                <h3>How to play</h3>
                <p>To play the game, you have to hatch bees and collect pollen. With the pollen you collect,
                    you can make honey by having your bees convert it at your hive. Honey is the main
                    currency for the game. With honey, you can buy more bees and better items. As you get
                    better at the game, you can buy better items that give more buffs and get the best bees
                    into your hive.</p>

                <h3>What makes the game challenging?</h3>
                <p>The game becomes challenging as you progress further into the game. Naturally, 
                    the better you become, the harder it is to become even better. However, at a certain 
                    point, it feels like you have plateaued. This makes many people give up on the game. 
                    However, you can actually still improve far beyond that point. This is where you can no 
                    longer continue to improve by simply grinding: you have to start strategizing more than 
                    ever before and learn how to improve on how you collect honey and the specifics of your 
                    hive composition as even the tiniest change can lead to big differences. For me 
                    personally, this just makes the game more exciting, especially since I have recently 
                    managed to break through the giant plateau everyone who plays enough eventually hits.

                <h3>Problems with the game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Becoming good enough to get onto the leaderboard requires alt accounts to help you 
                        grind
                    </li>
                    <li>Boosting as a pro gets very expensive in terms of in-game material, so it cannot 
                        be done very often
                    </li>
                    <li>The game requires A LOT of grinding</li>
                </ul>
